SUMMARY OF CHANGES: 7.6.2
The following changes have been delivered in this Maintenance Release.
CR4291 - This patch fixes an issue, where  the SO responses from STP are not delivered to STO due to loss of connection.
 It has been fixed such that , during housekeeping, the undelivered SO responses are recovered and sent to STO.
 It also includes fix for MwLink error during Housekeeping.
 Prior this fix, if Housekeeping was taking longer than the configured heartbeat timeout, links to JIP(which does Housekeeping) process is closed. This leads to Mwlink error messages.
 
 CR4493 - This patch enhances Tertio to allow selected error messages to be send as alarms via email or script.
 
 CR4500 - This patch fixes an issue in Tertio command line operation when CAF is down.
 When using CAF authentication, Tertio command line operations fail if CAF is unavailable. 
 Now, it is possible to stop the Tertio system if CAF is down.
 
 CR4505 - This patch fixes an issue of Service Order failure due to Incorrect Service Composer model being used for an In-Progress Service Order.
 Prior to this fix , the In-progress service order referred the latest generation in which service model was updated , instead of  the generation in which SO was submitted.
 Now this is fixed.
 
 CR4521 - This patch fixes an issue in Provisioning agents.
 Prior to this patch, the TCL Provisioning agents respawn intermittently due to memory corruption of link between Agent and ERP processes, during Configuration re-read operation. Now this is fixed
 
 CR4466 - This patch fixes an issue STP was not validating whether the SO was owned by another STP when Duplicate Key exception occurs.
 
 CR4388 - This patch fixes the memory leak issue while reading the configuration item that is not available.
 
 CR4491 - This patch fixes thread leak issue in ProvServer process.
 Prior to this patch while executing SYSStatus command, if CCAdmin process was unresponsive, there would be a thread leak in ProvServers for every SYSStatus command request. 
 Due to this the ProvServer was unable  to create new thread  and process any new CLI request. Now this is fixed.
 
 CR4575 - This patch resolves the conflicts in tertio 7.6.0 for PAgentStatus.h file
